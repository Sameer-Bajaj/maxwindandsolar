# Maximum Wind + Solar Share

Takes in csv of net generation (which can be generated through the EIA add-on for excel) and queries for the specific hour with the highest share of renewable energy (wind and solar) to 
find the weakest point in a given time frame inertia-wise. This allows for contextual analysis of patterns in demand and interchange given lack of power inertia.

Code written entirely by Sameer Bajaj for SMERC.
